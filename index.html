  <p><b><u>Frederic Lamoulie's Notes Lesson 1</u></b></o> 
    <p></p>A web page is a text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
     <b>HTML</b> stands for hypertext markup language. More details <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3851658626/m-3847388548">here</a>.
    <p><b>Coding</b> happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.</p>
    <p><b>Programmers</b> need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").

  <p><b><u>Basic HTML Vocabulary:</u></p>
</b>
<b>Tag</b>: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag.
<br>
<b>Element</b>: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>
<b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, <a href="www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a>
<br>
<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>:HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
